# Performed the most important step in process of model Building - 'Exploratory Data Analysis' on Netflix dataset.

In this project I have performed most important step of model building which 'Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)' on Netflix dataset and made the dataset clean enough that it is ready to feed to the model.

• Loaded many Python libraries necessary for performing EDA procedures.

• Checked for the shape and size of the dataset.

• Described the different statistical values like min, max, quartiles of numerical columns in dataset using .describe() function.

• Looked for the Value Counts for different features present in the dataset.

• Checked for any missing and duplicated values in the dataset and handled it properly by using .drop() function.

• Performed 'Feature understanding and feature relationship' another processes in the steps EDA.
